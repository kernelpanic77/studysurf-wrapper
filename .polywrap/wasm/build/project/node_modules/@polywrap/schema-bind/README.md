# @polywrap/schema-bind

Bind WRAP ABIs to a variety of supported languages through codegen.

## Usage

``` typescript
import { BindOptions, BindOutput, bindSchema } from "@polywrap/schema-bind";
import { parseSchema } from "@polywrap/schema-parse";

const schema = fetch("schema.graphql");
const abi = parseSchema(schema);

const input: BindOptions = {
  projectName: "Test",
  bindLanguage: "wasm-as",
  abi,
  schema,
  outputDirAbs: "/path/to/output/dir"
};

const output: BindOutput = bindSchema(input);
```

## Details

Polywrap uses MessagePack as a common data interchange format between languages. This allows Polywrap WASM modules, authored in different languages, to be run within a single host language (JS, Rust, Python, Go, C#, C++).

MessagePack encoded data is sent between module boundaries. Decoding of the message will happen in the destination environment, using generated binding code, created by this package.
